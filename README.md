# Gaussian_Mixture_Models
This repository contains the implementation of a 3-component, 2D Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) using Python. The project generates and visualizes samples from the GMM, displaying the joint distribution, marginal distribution, and the responsibility of each component in explaining the data.
